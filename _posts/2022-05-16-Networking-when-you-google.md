I took a lecture aimed at explaining what happens when you google something. It was more like how a website is accessed from networking perspective. This lecture touches:
- The Transport layer protocols
    - TCP
    - UDP
- Explains what happens when we search for a website on the browser
    - DNS
    - Packet exchange on the network
