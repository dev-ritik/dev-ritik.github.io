In the world dominated by big internet players like Google, Facebook, etc., most of our day to day internet traffic is routed to their servers. Virtually everything from E-commerce, Social Media, Web Streaming are increasingly controlled by some giant corporation. This centralisation leads to much of our valuable user data being stored and regulated by the rules they decide and most of us agree to without caring to read the terms of their service. They may distribute or leak it to other third party companies just like what happened in the case of Facebook-Cambridge Analytica.

Such a connected world requires a decentralised end-to-end encrypted social multimedia app. And when looking on it from Information-centric network perspective, NpChat seems quite promising.

`NpChat` (from [NDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking)\+ Snapchat) is an Android application that allows users to capture and share multimedia with friends in a secure and fully `decentralised` way, while still giving users complete control over their data. It is based on `Named Data Network`, a proposed evolution of the `IP` architecture that uses data-names(identifiers) as a kind of address and not just IP addresses. NDN aims to change the network fundamentally from end to end communication to content-based, wherein, not only IP address but also the data identifier and only the identifier can also be used to exchange information.
