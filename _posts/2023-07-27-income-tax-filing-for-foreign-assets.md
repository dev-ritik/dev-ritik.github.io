Filing for Income Tax in India is cumbersome. It's intimidating and confusing. To add to that, the laws keep changing. For a new individual who just started earning, the more things he touches, the more difficult it becomes to file for taxes. You know about 80C deductions! Great! Do you know what conversion rates to take when investing abroad? Ultimately, you would probably ignore foreign assets altogether with reasons like, “I didn’t sell, why bother”, or shrug it off to a CA. Let me tell you. Most CAs I have talked to don't know it correctly, either.

Not filing Foreign Assets or incorrectly filing can get you notices from the department. It may bring you under the purview of the Black Money Act. There are huge penalties, and individuals can also face jail time. Remember India and US have agreements through which they get details for the assets of their residents.
