Hey, I tried to gather some facts on the main candidates trying their luck in `Kishanganj Vidhan Sabha` seat for the Bihar Legislature election in the `Bihar election 2020`. I know most of you don’t even know the names of those who you will be voting for and that this piece of work won't change your political leaning or your decision, so take this as know your choice! Also, these are just secondary research from the data I could find on the internet. Please keep in mind that there may be errors in this data so please verify the data before using them.

> 54 Kishanganj Vidhan Sabha

## Candidates
- **MD. Qamrul Hoda** (AIMIM). He won the constituency in 2019 bye-election when the sitting Congress MLA won the MP seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
- **Ijaharul Husain** (INC). After the backlash in 2019, when Congress decided to give its ticket to the candidate from the family and lost badly, the party has decided to give it to a new face, a party worker.
- **Sweety Singh** (BJP): 3 times securing 2nd position, she has an ever-increasing vote per cent and has a good chance of being first this time.
- **Tasiruddin** (Indp): One of the independent candidate with a relatively poor performance in the recent election.

Below are the details of these major candidates. These data are largely taken from the affidavit submitted by them for contesting past state elections. These affidavit though is a good source of information but at times these are poorly filled.

I couldn't add a table here, so here’s their overall data

Candidates expenditure is recorded according to the Election Commission’s Guidelines. These are put in place to reduce the bias created because of the money power of the candidates. Candidates are required to maintain a register of the same and this register is compared with a shadow register maintained by the officials. This data is sourced from the same. Note that Qamrul Hoda was absent for the first term and presented a common report in the 2nd term. (However absent and not answering in a requested period is considered really bad). Third term’s report is yet to be uploaded.

Note that the dip in 2010 for Vidhan Sabha can be associated with the delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies Order, 2008
