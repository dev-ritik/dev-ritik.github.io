In the last blog on [HTTP](https://medium.com/@ritikk/http-websockets-9c6704e44a2a), I explained the working and evolution of `HTTP` towards better performance. As you might know, HTTP by itself isn’t secure. But that lock on the top left of your browser gives a sense of being safe on the internet. The Internet is a hostile place; my server’s access logs are the testimony!

> How is the HTTP traffic secured? What does that lock indicate? How do we establish trust? How can I say that indeed this is the article I was supposed to read!? Is this genuinely medium.com??

> I will explain the key concepts with examples related to them while trying to avoid as much technical jargon as possible.
