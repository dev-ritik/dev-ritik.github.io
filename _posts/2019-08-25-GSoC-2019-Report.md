# Android App Improvement

## Introduction
[NpChat](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app) is a photo and file-sharing application built on Android and is inspired by Snapchat. It runs over the Named Data Network (NDN) and focuses on decentralised information sharing architecture. It stands as one of the best examples of Android application developed on the new Internet architecture.

The project description can be found [here](https://named-data.net/gsoc-2019/#npchat). During Google Summer of Code 2019, I contributed to the project and developed several features to improve the NpChat app, its supporting library([Jndn](https://github.com/named-data/jndn)) and the [Identity Manager](https://github.com/zhtaoxiang/android-identity-manager).

## Work

During the GSoC period, I worked on the following,
<!--break-->
- <B>Replaces FaceProxy with Memorycache</B> ([#132](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/pull/132)) : Replaced `FaceProxy` (which used to store and serve data for interests) class with `Memorycache` class which uses `MemoryContentCache` (from  the `jNDN` library).

- <B>Aimd pipelining in Segment fetcher</B> ([#24](https://github.com/named-data/jndn/pull/24)) : Updated `SegmentFetcher.java` from the `jndn` library to use `AIMD` pipe-lining in place of the `fixed` window fetching. Ran some tests on [minindn](https://github.com/named-data/mini-ndn) to compare these strategies among the `jNDN` and [ndn-cxx](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx) libraries, the most recent of the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I11AvNxdttPvftFzk0DF_G650LGNkjGsK21mcumsysU/edit?usp=sharing). After a long review period and a list of changes, it was successfully merged.

- <B>Introduce MVVM architecture</B> ([#161](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/pull/161)) : The state of the code at that point was more or less ad-hoc with things like memory and network access specific code placed and used in the view itself against the encouraged application architecture patterns like MVVM. This Pull Request moved and reorganised the code to single Activity multiple Fragment MVVM architecture, with operation logics separated and organised into classes and packages.

- <B>Add location co-ordinates to pictures</B> ([#162](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/pull/162)) : Added a feature to let user geo-tag a picture. Once Geo-tagged, the location is shared by adding the co-ordinates into the `Exif` metadata and transformed to ground address using `Geocoder` class.

- <B>File sharing</B> ([#163](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/pull/163)) : Improved the pictures sharing and file browsing experience and separated them into status and files, to be viewed differently.

- <B>NDNCert java client</B> ([#1](https://github.com/zhtaoxiang/android-identity-manager/pull/1)): For the users to have a namespace, they must have a certificate for it. Previously, a self-signed certificate was used to verify the ownership. This PR updates the [Android Identity Manager](https://github.com/zhtaoxiang/android-identity-manager) to get signed certificates of the namespace using [NDNCERT](https://github.com/named-data/ndncert/wiki/NDNCERT-Protocol-0.2). This will be used to prove the ownership using the trust agent.

These PRs spans accross [NpChat](https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Adev-ritik+sort%3Acreated-asc), [jndn](https://github.com/named-data/jndn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Adev-ritik) and [android-identity-manager](https://github.com/zhtaoxiang/android-identity-manager/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Adev-ritik)

## TODO
- Publishing the app to Play Store.
- Adding ECDH key encryption to android-identity-manager.

## Challenges
As a part of the project, I faced some challenges, which gave me experiences in new fields

1. Moving to decentralised from the popular centralised server model.
2. The nature of the work (pretty much new and unprecedented).
3. Establishing and updating development environments and NDN dependencies.
4. Trying to establish ECDH key exchange.

## Future Works
I plan to continue working on the NDN concept, developing and contributing to open-source application and utilities, in the days to come.
