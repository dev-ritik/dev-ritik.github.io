_This work is a part of my presentation for the course `CSN-502 Advanced Operating System`. The presentation was delivered on 31.10.2020, and the topic for the same was `Network Access Control — EAP framework`. To my interest, I added focus to Wireless protocols as well. Most of the content can be found easily by Google search; hence if interested, I would recommend following the sources added in the references section. Take this one only as an introduction to the topic. The ppt is attached below._

## Network Access Control
You must have heard that open and coffee shop wifis are insecure, and one must proceed with cautions. Now think about large corporates or campus networks. There’s a ton of stuff involved here which are private within the network and must be protected via access control and prevented from eavesdropping. Remember, a network is not just used for connecting to the internet. A single malicious device or some malicious programs in some innocent device can bring massive troubles to the network providers. All other stuff related to secure access management applies here as well.

So broadly, it is the job of the Network Access Control System to proactively detect and authorize the devices and put certain access control in place. It should also provide a mechanism to deal with malicious programs and actors acting with bad faith from within or outside the network.
