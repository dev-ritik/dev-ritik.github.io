👋 Hi there! Thanks for stopping by ❤️!

I'm **Ritik Kumar**, a **Computer Science & Engineering graduate (IIT Roorkee, 2021)**, currently working as a **Software Engineer at Uber India**. I’m deeply passionate about **computer networks** and **backend engineering**, with hands-on experience building large-scale, high-performance systems.

Previously, I’ve worked as a **Backend Engineer at [Eightfold AI](https://eightfold.ai/)** on the data platform team, and as an **SDE at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/)** India in the Azure Networking organization.

I was also a **Google Summer of Code 2019 Developer** with the [NDN Project](https://named-data.net/project/), where I built **NpChat**, a peer-to-peer decentralized media-sharing app for Android based on Named Data Networking.

Over the years, I’ve interned with several leading startups and research groups, including:
- **Microsoft India**, contributing to the new **Edge (Anaheim)** browser built on Chromium
- **[Fampay](https://fampay.in)** — India’s first neobank for teenagers and their families — as a backend engineer
- **[Triomics](https://triomics.com/)** as a backend engineer
- **[SNL, UCSB](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/)** — the Systems and Networking Lab — as a research intern

Beyond work, I enjoy tinkering with **Linux 🐧**, debugging **web server internals**, and contributing to **open-source projects**. I’ve also built and maintained several popular apps used across the IIT Roorkee campus.

Outside of tech, I love **reading** ([books]({{site.books_domain}})📚), following **finance and markets 📈**, and diving into **modern history and geopolitics**, especially around World War II. You’ll also find me exploring new genres of **music** 🎶.

If anything here sparks your interest, feel free to connect — I’d love to chat! 🙂
