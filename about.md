Hi there! Thanks for stopping by!

I'm Ritik Kumar, 4th Year Senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, interested in Computer
networks. I am a research intern at [SNL](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) `(Systems and Networking Lab)` UCSB.  I have been
working as a Backend Developer for quite some time now.

I was `Google Summer of Code` Student Developer 2019 for [NDN](https://named-data.net/project/) `(Named Data Network)`
and worked on `NpChat`, a peer to peer decentralised media sharing application based on NDN for Android. I had interned
with `Microsoft India`, where I worked on their new `EDGE` `(Anaheim)` browser-based on `Chromium`. Recently, I
interned at [Fampay](https://fampay.in) as a Backend Engineer. I have also contributed to some open-sourced projects. I
have also developed and maintained a few widely used apps for the campus.

I am mostly building cool stuff, usually around Linux messing with configs or fixing some issues in web servers hosted
on `AWS`. My other hobbies include reading and consuming stuff about modern history & geopolitics, particularly around
WW II. I also like listening to all kinds of music.

If you found anything around interesting, use any of the channels below to connect with me:)
