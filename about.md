👋 Hi there! Thanks for stopping by ❤️!

I'm Ritik Kumar, 2021 Computer Science & Engineering graduate🎓 from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, interested
in Computer networks. I am a Software Engineer at `Microsoft India` in the Azure Networking team. I have good
experience working as a Backend Developer👨‍💻.

I was `Google Summer of Code` Student Developer 2019 for [NDN](https://named-data.net/project/) `(Named Data Network)`
and worked on `NpChat`, a peer to peer decentralised media sharing application based on NDN for Android. I had interned
with `Microsoft India`, where I worked on their new `EDGE` `(Anaheim)` browser-based on `Chromium`. Recently, I
interned at [Fampay](https://fampay.in) & [Triomics](https://triomics.in/) as a Backend Engineer. I worked as a research
intern at [SNL](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) `(Systems and Networking Lab)` UCSB. I have also contributed to some
open-sourced projects. In the past, I have also developed and maintained a few widely used apps for the IIT Roorkee
campus.

I mostly build and analyse cool stuff, usually around Linux🐧 and networking or fixing issues in web servers. My other
hobbies include reading books📚, finance📈 and consuming stuff about modern history & geopolitics, particularly around
WW II. I also like listening to all kinds of music.
